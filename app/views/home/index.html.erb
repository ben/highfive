          As any seasoned HR professional will tell you, people respond more to the acclaim of their peers than to monetary incentives.
          When someone congratulates you for an accomplishment, particularly in public, you feel a lot better than if your boss gives you a dinner voucher.
          Highfive is a low-friction peer-reward system that really works, and makes your team happier.

          Using the <a href="https://tangocard.com">Tangocard</a> service, we take a small margin whenever you buy a gift card for a member of your team, but this is completely transparent for you.
          When you spend $25 on a gift card, you get a $25 gift card.
          No fees, no subscription, and we don't retain any of your financial information.
